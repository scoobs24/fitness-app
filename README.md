# Brennan Rose and Kyle Meredith Capstone Spring 2021

Flutter health and nutrition tracking application.
The meal tracking page and navigation have been implemented so far.
The application prototype opens to the main page.
In the top left there is a navigation button depicted by three horizontal lines.
Upon pressing the button a side navigation will slide out.
The meal page can be accessed by tapping/clicking on the meals tab.

In the meal page, the date can be changed by tapping/clicking on different dates on the calendar.
To add a new page to a day click/tap on the button with the plus icon in the bottom right corner.
This will bring up text inputs for the food name and the amount of calories.
After entering both a name, and calories the meal will be added to a list for that day.

All Dart files that we worked on are located in the "lib" folder. 

The "capstone" file must be placed in the Flutter project folder.
